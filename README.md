# project overview

# components

# improvements

### dropdown/dropdownSelection open/close toggle
- the chevron could be replaced with a slot to allow customization
- alternative to global onclick event handler to determine if the user wanted to collapse the dropdown. might be polluting + cause a performance hit because it gets called on every click.

### component customization
- components could be more customizable with the usage of slots


### themeing
- style themeing

### design considerations and questions

- how reusable should a component be?
  - purely functional vs mixed form + function?
